This was my midterm project for data analytics, spring 2024. The goal was to preprocess a dataset of our choice and showcase some of our findings. 

I ended up focusing more on working with Spotify's api and comparing top song data found from the api vs data found on Kaggle. 

Things I would do differently:
  I would create a more complex and focused starting question. 
  Select a larger dataset.
