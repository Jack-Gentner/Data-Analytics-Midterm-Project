This was my midterm project for data analytics, Spring 2024. The objective was to preprocess a dataset of our choice and present our findings.

I ended up delving into the Spotify API, comparing top song data obtained from the API with data sourced from Kaggle.

Things I would do differently:
  Formulate a more intricate and targeted initial research question.
  Opt for a larger dataset for analysis.
